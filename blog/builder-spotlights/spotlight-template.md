## What is <Project> in one line

A crisp sentence anyone can repeat.

## Why this matters

What problem are you solving in the real world? Who benefits?

## Why identity (and why Self)

The moment identity became a blocker.  
How Self fixes it with zero-knowledge proofs (no data handed over, just a cryptographic **yes**).

**Proofs used:** <list from front matter>  
**Verifier learns:** <verifier_learns>  
**Flow:** <flow in one phrase, e.g., "scan QR, get a yes/no">

## How it works (short flow)

- User action → proof generation with Self
- Verifier checks policy → gets yes/no
- App unlocks feature/access on **yes**

If helpful, drop a quick diagram image in `assets/`.
