# Builder Spotlights (Drafts for self.xyz/blog)

This folder holds **draft spotlight posts** written by residency builders. Keep each spotlight in its own subfolder:  
`YYYY-MM-DD-<project-or-builder-slug>/`

## How to contribute

1. Create a folder: `blog/builder-spotlights/2025-10-28-your-project/`
2. Copy `spotlight-template.md` into `index.md` inside your folder.
3. Add 1 hero image to `assets/hero.jpg` and 1–2 optional images.
4. Fill the template with clear, human language. Aim for **600–900 words**.
5. Open a PR titled: `[spotlight] your-project`.
